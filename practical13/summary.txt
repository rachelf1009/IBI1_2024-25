The length of Human SOD2 sequence is 222AA and subcellular localisation is mitochondria.


The percentage identity of these alignments ranged from 83.3% to 100%.This suggests that 
SOD2 is a highly conserved protein across species
The best alignment with the mouse SOD2 protein (UniProt ID: P09671) showed a 90.1% identityï¼Œindicating strong 
evolutionary conservation between the two species

According to the identity and alignment score, the rat SOD2 and human SOD2 sequences are most closely related
compared to rat SOD2 and random sequence, and human SOD2 and random sequence.
