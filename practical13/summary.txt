The length of Human SOD2 sequence is 222AA and subcellular localisation is mitochondrion matrix.


The percentage identity of these alignments ranged from 58.1% to 100%.This suggests that 
SOD2 is a highly conserved protein across species
The best alignment with the mouse SOD2 protein (UniProt ID: P09671) showed a 90.1% identityï¼Œindicating strong 
evolutionary conservation between the two species

Score between Mouse sequence and Human sequence: 1097 Identity between Rat sequence and Human sequence: 90.09009009009009 %
Score between Mouse sequence and random sequence: -245 Identity between Rat sequence and random sequence: 6.306306306306306 %
Score between Human sequence and random sequence: -263 Identity between Human sequence and random sequence: 4.504504504504505 %
According to the identity and alignment score, the Mouse SOD2 and human SOD2 sequences are most closely related
compared to Mouse SOD2 and random sequence, and human SOD2 and random sequence.
