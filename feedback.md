After scanning through the feedback, I found several things that I previously didn't pay attention to.

The requirements in the document may not be fully concluded in the "for your portfolio" sessions. So it is suggested to read the whole instruction rather than only focusing on the "for your protofio" session".

One crucial suggestion in the feedback is that the name of each commit. I used to randomly choose the date as the commit name, and it is not valid and informative at all. I'll treat all the commit messages seriously and try to summarize each adjustment clearly in future tasks.

This feedback has given me such an oppurtunity to review what I didn't pay attention and things that I need to improve for better coding capability.
