This practical was engaging and helped me understand how simple rules can model complex disease spread
Building the basic SIR model and adding vaccination scenarios were straightforward and rewarding. 
The spatial SIR model was more challenging due to handling neighbors and edge cases, but I learned a lot about structuring code and simulating local interactions. 
Overall, this task improved my confidence in using Python for biological modeling.
